# ktools
Linux command-line tools that might be of general interest.

- run_para: run commands in parallel, showing their real-time output
  in a dashboard and (optionally) keeping an organized output transcript.

- ratelimiter: incorporate easy rate-limits into shell scripts

- q: a collection of Linux shortcuts, tools, and bash tricks.
  (Much of this is specialized for my personal home environment and
   won't be of general interest, but some of the techniques might
   be useful.)
