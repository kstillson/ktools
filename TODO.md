## ++ktools tech
   - ~all docker tests fail on blue
   - review non-doc TODO's
   - re-confirm virgin build process
     - (pi2) :everything didn't run :prep
     - (pi2) wrong perms for some py sys libs; fix umask on initial sudo'd pip?
     - ? chmod 444 /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid
   - make e -> make all ?

## treasure hunt
   - A's idea about several analytics collectors- prominantly document #1,
     subtlely document #2, and really hide #3 (dns query only?).  encourage
     code reviews, and make ppl think about foss security.

## ++ktools prose
   - review all doc TODO's
   - makefiles- lots of explanations and intros
   - general wisdom: lots of writing
   - overall spellcheck and markdown linting

## General
   - new name for ktools ?  (kcore?  kdev?  Mauveine?  #8D029B)
     A: kwisdom/kwizdom?  (nb with k*: confusion w/ kuberneties)
     kwizmet ?

## ---------- MILESTONE: ready for peer review ...?

## deferred homectrl related
   - add RPi.GPIO (i.e. buttons) to circuitpy_sim and kcore/gpio
   - graphical interface for inputs and outputs
   - homectrl push update to all
