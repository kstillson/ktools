## ++ktools tech
   - other docks: web
   - nagdock test fails
   - keymaster: add last used key date
   - review non-doc TODO's
   - re-confirm virgin build process
     - (pi2) :everything didn't run :prep
     - (pi2) wrong perms for some py sys libs; fix umask on initial sudo'd pip?
     - ? chmod 444 /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid 
   
## General
   - new name for ktools ?  (kcore?  kdev?  Mauveine?  #8D029B)

## ++ktools prose
   - review all doc TODO's
   - makefiles- lots of explanations and intros
   - TOC / general intro write-up
   - general wisdom: lots of writing

## ---------- MILESTONE: ready for peer review ...?

## deferred homectrl related
     - h/control:ext -> hc.py (needs kcore in webdock, which probably means conversion to ktools-based build)
   - add RPi.GPIO (i.e. buttons) to circuitpy_sim and kcore/gpio
      - graphical interface for inputs and outputs
   - homectrl remote update (?)

## homesec
   - rebind to ktools

## Other
   - search for things that need to be rebound / updated to new ktools interfaces (e.g. art-projects)
