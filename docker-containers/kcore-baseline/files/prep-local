# This is the hardening script specific to the kcore-baseline image.

# Note that kcore-baseline/Dockerfile executes this script (rather than /prep,
# as is usually done), because we only want minimal hardening at this stage;
# other images that inhereit from kcore-baseline will need a fully-functioning
# Alpine image in order to install and customize their packages.

# Once this script completes it's limited hardening, it self-deletes, so
# it doesn't conflict with /prep-local files in images that inhereit from
# kcore-baseline.  The purpose of those files is to customize /prep actions
# for particular images, so we don't want to interfere with them.

# ----------

# Make sure local root is not passwordless.
sed -i -e 's/root:::/root:!::/' /etc/shadow

# get python3 requests module
pip3 install requests

# And no need to keep this file around anymore.
rm -f ${0}
