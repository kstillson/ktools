# pylib/etc

This is a collection of very small and simple Python tools that I consider too
trivial or too special-case to deserve placement in the ../tools directory,
but which I figured I'd go ahead and release anyway, in-case they happen to be
of use to anyone else.

In general I don't even bother to implement tests for these, although if anyone
out there feels they deserve them, please feel free to push `um my way.
