# tools-etc

This is a collection of small and simple tools that I consider too trivial,
too informal, or too special-case to deserve placement in one of the more
proper tools directories, but which I figured I'd go ahead and release anyway,
in-case they happen to be of use to anyone.

I haven't bothered to implement Makefile installers or tests for these...

But I do have a little documentation inside each one, so feel free to take a
look, and make use of anything that appeals to you.


The subdirectory ./Tasker has a bunch of my scripts for the Android Tasker
app.  See [README-Tasker](Tasker/README-Tasker.md) for details.
