# tools for root: stand-alone Linux command-line tools

- q: a collection of Linux shortcuts, tools, and bash tricks.  Hopefully it
  will eventually be detangled so the parts that are hopelessly bound with
  the details of the author's personal configuration can be separated out.
  But it's being published anyway. because this script contains considerable
  wisdom in using and managing a small-to-medium fleet of Linux systems, and
  contains a repository of bash tips and techniques that provide a good
  reference for such things.

- iptables_log_sum: summarize rejected packets from iptables logs.

- rsnap-diff: generates a consolidated report of the files which have changed
  between two directories.  Intended to summarize changes since the previous
  day's rsnapshot backup, for all systems included in the backup.
