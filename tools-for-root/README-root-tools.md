# tools for root: stand-alone Linux command-line tools

  * q: a collection of Linux shortcuts, tools, and bash tricks.  Hopefully it
    will eventually be detangeled so the parts that are hopelessly bound with
    the details of the author's personal configuration can be separated out.
    But it's being published anyway. because this script contains considerable
    wisdom in using and managing a small-to-medium fleet of Linux systems, and
    contains a repository of bash tips and techniques that provide a good
    reference for such things.

  * iptables_log_sum: summarize rejected packets from iptables logs.
